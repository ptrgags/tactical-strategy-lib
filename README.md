# tactical-strategy-lib
Library of classes for making turn-based tactical strategy games. Right now
I'm still in the early development stages, so not everything is working completely

## How to use
From the project directory, compile the CoffeeScript files to javascript:
```
mkdir scripts
coffee -o scripts -c coffee
```
