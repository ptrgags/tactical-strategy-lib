# tactical-strategy-lib
Library of classes for making turn-based tactical strategy games. Right now
I'm still in the early development stages, so not everything is working
yet. Additionally, the files in the repo may change many times in the
early stages of development

## How to use
From the project directory, compile the CoffeeScript files using the
following commands

```
mkdir -p scripts
coffee -o scripts -c coffee
```

If you have Rake installed, you can use the included rakefile:

```
rake coffee
```

Finally, open up index.html in the browser to view the demo at the
current state!
